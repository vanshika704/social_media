# Social_media 
# Aim :
The primary goal of this project is to develop a social media application with a brief and functional implementation of APIs using React.js. This project also serves as a practice platform for learning and reinforcing concepts of Bootstrap and Chakra UI for responsive and modern UI design.

Below is the basic UI preview of the application:[Screenshot (429)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20d8f106-610e-4eba-a148-429828d66551)
